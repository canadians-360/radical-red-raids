# Radical Red Raids: A Cobblemon Raid Dens Expansion

This pack significantly expands the Cobblemon Raid Dens raiding experience by introducing hundreds of rare encounters featuring custom-curated move sets and powerful new ability combinations. These changes are inspired by the popular ROM hack Radical Red.

_No affiliation with Radical Red or Radical Trainer mods._

## Main Features

*   223+ Unique Raid Additions: Encounter a massive variety of Pokémon specifically optimized for a more challenging and rewarding raid experience.
*   Custom Abilities & Moves: Face off against (and catch!) Pokémon with otherwise unobtainalbe or rare ability-move combos, such as Mega Launcher Magmortar, Technician Donphan, or Simple Magcargo.
*   30+ Regional Variants: Adds "Radical" regional pokemon with new stats/types. Example: Water/Dragon Lapras or Electric/Fighting Electivire.
*   Competitive Movesets: Every Pokémon has been assigned a hopefully challenging moveset inspired by competitive Smogon sets (taking into account new moves/abilities/etc.), ensuring every raid feels like a tough boss battle.
